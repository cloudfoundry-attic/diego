# Diego

Diego is Cloud Foundry's next-generation container management runtime system.  It is made up of a variety of small components, each with its own repository.

The *de facto* hub for all things Diego is [Diego-Release](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/diego-release), the repository for the [BOSH](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh) release of Diego. Please consult its README for information on Diego and links to other resources, and raise general issues about the project there.
